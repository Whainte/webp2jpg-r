webp2jpg-r
this program converts ALL .webp files in the current folder AND IT'S ALL SUBFOLDERS into .jpg format.
the current version does NOT detect .webp files that are not webp images. be causious.
the program doesnt receive any parameters from the shell and is currently for webp->jpg only.

This package includes ImageMagick, by ImageMagick Studio LLC
